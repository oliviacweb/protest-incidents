# Protest Incidents

## Turing Front End Mod 3 final solo project
This app allows people to search by state and then city to find stories of police brutality against protesters. You can choose a state from the drop down menu, get a list of cities and an 'all cities' option, click on the button you'd like to view and then see cards displaying info about particular incidents. 
You can then click the star at the top of the card to save the story from that city. And press View saved stories to view the ones you've saved.

## To use
clone the repository and run:
npm install
npm start


## Continuing Work 
* Do more testing - I have had a lot of difficulty with integration testing
* Styling - make this app more aesthetic
* Cross Browser Compatability
* Add functionality to make it possible for people to post their own stories to the database
